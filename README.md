# Simple Programs in C++
### A collection of programs I wrote while learning the basics of programming (from OSU's CS162 course)


## Dante's Inferno
### A text based game where the protagonist traverses the 9 circles of Hell by striking deals with dieties and battling demons to save a loved one, following the instructions left by Dante Alighieri.

## Dice Battle "Boardgame"
### A fantasy combat "boardgame" with "dice"

## Critters
### A simple predator/prey model where : and @ inhabit a small 2D array, where they live, eat, reproduce, and die

## Shopping List
### Very simple program where a user can create a shopping list with items, quantities, units, and cost per unit

## Labs

### Lab A
Write, compile, and test a program that uses multiple files and arrays

### Lab B
Design, write, compile, and test a program that uses class inheritance

### Lab C
Implement recursive functions and practice file I/O

### Lab D
Refine requirements for a program using inheritance Implement the requirements using polymorphism and Object Oriented Programming

### Lab E
 Implement a linked structure structures (circular linked list) using pointers


### Lab F
Implement linear data structures using linked structures

### Lab G
Implement a queue and simple algorithms for searching and sorting

### Lab H
Compare the runtime of the iterative and recursive implementation of the same algorithm.


### To Do:
- [ ] Add automated option to Critters
- [ ] Make the dice board game less automated, maybe find a way to make it more exciting
- [ ] Make Dante's Inferno game harder and the minetaur battle more exciting
- [ ] Clean up the code in some of the programs
