/*****************************************************************************************
 ** Function: Main Function
 ** Description: This is the main function for a simple program that prompts the user for
 *                  an input file, from which it extracts the contents into an array of
 *                  chars. The array is then passed to a recursive function which
 *                  reverses the order of its contents. The user is then prompted for
 *                  the name of an exiting output file. once successfully accessed,
 *                  the contents of the array are written into the output file.
 ** Parameters: None
 ** Pre-Conditions: An input file, output file, and existing reverse() function (@ end)
 ** Post-Conditions: The output file now contains the contents of the first file,
 *                   in reverse.

  while(inputFile >> numList[i])
 
 for(int i=0; i<listSize; i++) {
 outputFile << numList[i]
 
 
 so I open the file then store the integers in an array with
 from Keisha to jake (privately):
 while(inputFile >> numList[i])
 from Keisha to jake (privately):
 then as a test right below it I have cout << numList[i]; to make sure its copying correctly
 from Keisha to jake (privately):
 then I have an if statement that grows the array if it gets full
 from jake to Keisha (privately):
 how do you deal with empty spaces?
 from jake to Keisha (privately):
 What I did is I went through the file and counted the number of ints, then I made an array the size of the number of ints
 from jake to Keisha (privately):
 and I pretty much used the same code in a for loop
 from Keisha to jake (privately):
 hmmm I haven't run into that issue.  My text files is a list of numbers so 1 <enter> 99 <enter> 45 <enter>
 from jake to Keisha (privately):
 Oh sorry, I meant empty sdpaces in the array
 from jake to Keisha (privately):
 like you can't have a null int because that's just 0
 from Keisha to jake (privately):
 oh I initialize it to zero then fill it any extra spaces are still zero.  I just explained  in my design document
 from jake to Keisha (privately):
 but then you can't find the 0
 from jake to Keisha (privately):
 I guess that's not a bad idea though, gets you most of the points still
 from jake to Keisha (privately):
 I'm wondering if a while loop will work
 from jake to Keisha (privately):
 how did you output your sorted array? outFile.put(int) or outFile >> int ?
 from Keisha to jake (privately):
 yeah, I contemplated making them -1 but then theoretically the user could provide a text file with negatives, zeros and positives so I just explained that in my design doc
 from Keisha to jake (privately):
 I think the prof was just using 0 as an example anyway
 from jake to Keisha (privately):
 yeah
 from Keisha to jake (privately):
 I did a for loop
